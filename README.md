<h2>Overview: </h2>
Scrambled Scrolls is a rogue-like word game with the core gameplay of Scrabble. Our game consists of five stages, each stage being harder to clear. If the player fails to clear a stage, they fail the game and the game will restart. Players fail to clear a stage if their ending score is below the required score for the stage.

<h2>Rules:  </h2>
    1. The game is single player.<br>
    2. <b><u>Tile Bag</u></b>: A pool of additional tiles is drawn from throughout the game, replenishing players' hands after each turn.<br>
    3. <b><u>Forming Words</u></b>: On a player's turn, they must form a valid word:<br>
        - The word must be placed horizontally or vertically.<br>
        - The word must connect with existing tiles on the board if it is not the first move.<br>
    4. <b><u>First Word</u></b>: The first word must be placed so that one of its tiles covers the center square.<br>
    5. <b><u>Scoring</u></b>: The score for each word is the sum of the letter values.<br>
    6. <b><u>Tile Replacement</u></b>: After a player places tiles on the board, they draw new tiles from the tile bag to bring their hand back to 7 tiles.<br>
